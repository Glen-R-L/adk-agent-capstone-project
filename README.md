# Problem & Solution

Education is often delivered with a "one size fits all" approach (especially in schools etc). This is an early iteration of an agent which can help to teach a subject within an e-learning environment while enhancing customisation of delivery for the learner. The idea is to be developed further for proper implementation of the core idea.
